# Description
US presidents serve four year terms, with most presidents serving one or two terms. Unless a president dies in office, they then live after leaving office.
This challenge, then, given a list of presidents and their dates of birth and dates of death, is to figure out what year the most presidents - future, present, or previous - were alive.

# Input
A CSV input of presidential birthdates and death dates. The CSV file will have the following format: PRESIDENT,  BIRTH DATE, BIRTH PLACE,    DEATH DATE, LOCATION OF DEATH

#Output
Any of the following years is valid: 1822, 1823, 1824, 1825, 1826, 1831, 1833, 1834, 1835, 1836, 1837, 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1845 (each year had 18 presidents, current, former, or to be, alive).
